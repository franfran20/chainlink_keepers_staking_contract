# Purpose
1. The staking contract will allow users deposit a specific token(We will make this accept more tokens in the future).
2. Users receive a bonus for staking in our platform after a certain time using chainlink keepers.
3. Users will be able to unstake and have their rewards.
4. The sick thing here is the chainlink keepers and how we use em to automate smart contracts. Thats the big takeaway here. Use this to build some awesome stuff!
